## VL6180X SUMMARY

A Basic project that reads range measurement from VL6180X

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

SysConfig generates the driver configurations into the __ti_drivers_config.c__
and __ti_drivers_config.h__ files. Information on pins and resources used
is present in both generated files. The SysConfig user interface can also be
utilized to determine pins and resources used.

* `CONFIG_I2C_TMP` - I2C bus used to communicate with the VL6180x sensor.

## BoosterPacks, Board Resources & Jumper Settings


> If you're using an IDE such as Code Composer Studio (CCS) or IAR, please
refer to Board.html in your project directory for resources used and
board-specific jumper settings.

The Board.html can also be found in your SDK installation:

        <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/boards/<BOARD>

## Example Usage

* Example output is generated through use of Display driver APIs. Refer to the
Display driver documentation found in the SimpleLink MCU SDK User's Guide.

* Open a serial session (e.g. [`PuTTY`](http://www.putty.org/ "PuTTY's
 Homepage"), etc.) to the appropriate COM port.
 * The COM port can be determined via Device Manager in Windows or via
 `ls /dev/tty*` in Linux.

The connection will have the following settings:
```
    Baud-rate:     115200
    Data bits:          8
    Stop bits:          1
    Parity:          None
    Flow Control:    None
```

* The example will request range measurements from VL6180X in One Shot Mode. Measurements will only be printed if there is no error and its within the measurable range.


TI-RTOS:

* When building in Code Composer Studio, the kernel configuration project will
be imported along with the example. The kernel configuration project is
referenced by the example, so it will be built first. The "release" kernel
configuration is the default project used. It has many debug features disabled.
These feature include assert checking, logging and runtime stack checks. For a
detailed difference between the "release" and "debug" kernel configurations and
how to switch between them, please refer to the SimpleLink MCU SDK User's
Guide. The "release" and "debug" kernel configuration projects can be found
under &lt;SDK_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/kernel/tirtos/builds/&lt;BOARD&gt;/(release|debug)/(ccs|gcc).

FreeRTOS:

* Please view the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` header file for example configuration
information.

* It interfaces via the I2C Driver..
